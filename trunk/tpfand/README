tpfand controls the system fan of ThinkPad notebooks based on specified 
temperature profiles. Seperate trigger points can be configured for every
temperature sensor in the notebook.

tpfand is written entirely in Python and licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

"sudo make install-systemd" and "sudo systemctl enable tpfand".
Reboot your system to finish the install process.

If you use a distribution with sysvinit (e.g Debian or Ubuntu), run
