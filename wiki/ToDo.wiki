= Project To-Do List =

loose collection of ideas/known bugs for the experimental versions

  * tpfand can't read profile files properly (profile_override=False)
  * sensor_names list indices are strings (must be integers)!
  * add ability to load arbitrary profile files
  * machine_id in profile
  * failure of "modprobe -r thinkpad_acpi" should trigger reboot 
  * use default hwmon sensor if ibm_thermal is not available : /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input
  * tpfand should be able to ouptut debug messages to a log file or to syslog
  * correction factors for hwmon?
  * move tpfand from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin
  * pygtk require (Lucid and Squeeze/Wheezy)
  * switch to Python 3 and Gtk3?
  * Lucid support must be dropped at some point (EOL 04/2013 ??)
  * A lot of work to do in tpfan-admin ...
