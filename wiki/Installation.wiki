To install simply download 3 deb packages from the [http://code.google.com/p/tpfanco/ project's front page]: _tpfand_, _tpfan-admin_ and _tpfan-profiles_.

First install _tpfand_, then _tpfan-profiles_ and finally _tpfan-admin_. Reboot your system. Now open tpfan-admin and click *Unlock*. Select *Control system fan by software*. If there's no profile for your Thinkpad you will have to configure fan speeds by hand.
