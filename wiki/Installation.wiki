= Supported Ubuntu versions =

Tpfanco officially suports all Ubuntu versions older than Karmic (i.e. Lucid, Maverick, Natty etc.). 

To install simply download 3 deb packages from the [http://code.google.com/p/tpfanco/ project's front page]: _tpfand_, _tpfan-admin_ and _tpfan-profiles_.

First install _tpfand_, then _tpfan-profiles_ and finally _tpfan-admin_. Reboot your system. Now open tpfan-admin and click *Unlock*. Select *Control system fan by software*. If there's no profile for your Thinkpad you will have to configure fan speeds by hand.

= Unsupported Ubuntu versions =
For Ubuntu versions older than Lucid (i.e. Karmic, Jaunty, Intrepid, Hardy) use old packages from [https://launchpad.net/~tp-fan/+archive/ppa Sebastian Urban's Launchpad page]

= Possible confusements =

When installing _tpfand_ you might see this error
{{{
Fatal error: unable to set fanspeed, enable watchdog or read temperature
            Please make sure you are root and a recent
            thinkpad_acpi module is loaded with fan_control=1
                                                                        [fail]
}}}

And if you try to run tpfan-admin you will probably see this:
{{{
Unable to connect to ThinkPad Fan Control daemon (tpfand).

Please make sure you are running this program on a supported IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad,
a recent thinkpad_acpi module is loaded with fan_control=1 and tpfand has been started.
}}}

These errors are normal if you're installing _tpfan_ and _tpfan-admin_ for the first time. As long as the packages are installed without errors, there is nothing to be worried about. Just restart your system and should be fine. Check the [http://code.google.com/p/tpfanco/wiki/FAQ?ts=1315049475&updated=FAQ#Why_do_I_have_to_restart_my_system_after_installing_tp-fan_packa FAQ] for more information on why you need to restart.
